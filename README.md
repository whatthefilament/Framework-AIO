# Framework-AIO
3D Printable Case for Framework Laptop that converts it into an AIO style Desktop Computer

I've used as many OEM Framework parts as possible.

## Assembly

[Build Instructions](https://www.instructables.com/Framework-AIO-Assembly/)

To help organize parts for this project, feel free to check out my [Framework parts tray](https://www.printables.com/model/253099-framework-parts-tray)

For assembly, you will need the following:

- 14 - M3 heat inserts (short)
- 10 - M3 x 4mm screws
- 4 - M3 x 8mm screws
- 1 - M2 x 6mm Self tap Screw
- 30 - 6mm x 3mm Magnets

- A small mallet/hammer to press in magnets (They are designed to be tight)
- M3 hex key
- Small head Phillips screwdriver (the one that comes with the Framework laptop works great)
- Soldering iron or other similar heat press insert tool
#
From the laptop itself you will need the following:

- Mainboard
- Expansion Cards
- Audio Board
- Wi-Fi Module
- Wi-Fi Antenna (Highly recommended that you buy a new one from Framework for the build, the antennas are very thin and break easily when attempting to remove from the display housing)
- Speakers
- Display
- Webcam and webcam ribbon cable
- Display Hinge (Specifically the left one with the L stamped onto it) I havent tried the new high weight hinges so I don't know if they work. I designed using the original hinges.

## Print Settings:

I recommend printing all case parts of either ASA or ABS as this provides the best heat resistance. PETG may also work but I have not fully tested it. 

This case is designed to be printed at 0.2mm layer height with a 0.4mm nozzle.

No printed supports are needed. All holes have built-in supports. STLs are properly oriented for correct printing.

The main case has an overall dimension is 301.15mm x 231mm x 21. 

Thought many of the parts can be printed on a smaller printer. The main chassis and bezel will need a printer that can accommodate at least 301mm. 

## Mounting Options

In addition to the stock desk stand i've also included a 75mm VESA mount option for mounting on monitor arms.

I've uploaded the step files for the model as well, feel free to modify the design however you'd like.
